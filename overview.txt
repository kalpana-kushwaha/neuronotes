Awesome — you're making solid, professional progress.

---

Here’s your **finalized roadmap** tailored for your goal of **shipping fast** and getting a **resume-worthy full-stack AI app** ready:

---

## ✅ Project Strategy: **Frontend-First Approach**

### 🎯 Why This Works Best for You:

* You get visual, demo-ready progress fast (great for motivation + portfolio)
* You’ll build backend APIs only when needed (no wasted code)
* You'll finish a polished UI that looks impressive even before full backend is complete

---

## 🚀 **7-Day Fast-Track Plan for NeuroNotes**

> Stack: React + Vite + MUI (frontend), FastAPI + SQLite (backend), local dev with VS Code

---

### ✅ **Day 1: Project Setup (DONE)**

✅ React + Vite + MUI setup
✅ Folder structure + routing (`/`, `/notes`, `/search`, `/dashboard`)
✅ FastAPI app scaffolded
✅ Health check working
⏳ DB not yet connected (will do on Day 3)

---

### 🔜 **Day 2: Notes UI (Frontend Only)**

📄 Create **note form**: title, content, tags
🧱 Create **NoteCard** component
🧠 Save notes to local state (no backend yet)
📦 Optional: persist notes to localStorage (for demo effect)

---

### 🔜 **Day 3: Backend Notes API + Connect to Frontend**

🗃️ SQLite with SQLModel
🔌 Routes: `GET /notes`, `POST /notes`, `DELETE /notes/{id}`
🔗 Axios in frontend to replace local notes with real API

---

### 🔜 **Day 4: Smart Search (Basic NLP)**

🔍 Add `GET /notes/search?q=...` using spaCy or TF-IDF
🔎 Frontend search bar & results display

---

### 🔜 **Day 5: AI Features – Summarization & Auto-tagging**

🧠 Add `/summarize/{note_id}` + `/tag/{note_id}`
📌 Show summary + tags in frontend

---

### 🔜 **Day 6: Dashboard & Analytics UI**

📊 Stats on tags, note count, note history
📈 Visual charts with `recharts` or `chart.js`

---

### 🔜 **Day 7: Deployment & Resume Polish**

🚀 Deploy to Vercel + Render
📸 Add screenshots, polish design
📄 Finalize README + resume bullet

---

### Bonus: **Day 8 (Polish & Extras)**

🌙 Dark mode, markdown notes, export to PDF
🔐 Add login with Firebase or JWT
📤 Portfolio-ready landing page

---

### 🧭 Next Step:

Let’s start **Day 2: Notes UI (form + list)**
We’ll:

1. Build the **Note creation form** with MUI
2. Build a `NoteCard` to show note title + body
3. Store notes in local state

Say **"ready for Day 2"** and I’ll guide you through the first real screen!
